      <em>The Secret History</em>, debut novel of Donna Tartt, was published in
      1992 and is about the mysterious antics between an elite and selective
      group of college students. Set in remote Vermont, the main character,
      Richard Papen, attends Hampton College and finds himself intangled between
      a preexisting clique of students studying Greek.

      It's a very autumnal read and I highly suggest you light one too many
      candles while reading to enjoy the book to the absolute maxiumum. If you
      want to go a step further, spin a Smiths (or some other pompous band)
      vinyl on an Audio Technica turntable and drink a scourching cup of BLACK
      COFFEE because reading this book makes you feel like you're better than
      everyone else. Speaking of candles, I have a "Spiced Apple Toddy" candle
      that I bought from Bath and Body Works around 3 years ago and I finally
      cracked it open and placed it on my windowsill. It smells great.

      All in all, <em>The Secret History</em> is great because it immerses you
      in a highly academic setting but never bores you. Some might disagree
      (namely Ms. Hall) but their opinions don't matter because Donna Tartt is a
      <strong>PULITZER-PRIZE-WINNING-AUTHOR</strong> and she's pretty good at
      her craft. Then again, she won that Pultizer for a different book...but
      nonetheless, she's awesome and very skilled.

      P.S. While working on this website, I discovered that stock photos on
      Google have been completely overrun with AI generated images. Not only is
      that a complete disgrace to photography and the stock photo industry,
      they're <strong>UGLY</strong> and <strong>LIFELESS</strong>.
